# 🗡️ RogueLikeDungeonGame

**RogueLikeDungeonGame** is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler built with Python. The game focuses on procedurally generated dungeons, player exploration and combat, enemy AI behavior, loot collection, and classic permadeath mechanics to deliver a challenging and highly replayable experience.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project implements a complete roguelike gameplay loop where each run is unique. Dungeons are generated randomly, enemies behave dynamically, and the player must survive using strategy and skill. The codebase is modular and structured to allow easy extension of gameplay mechanics.

The project covers:

- Procedural dungeon generation  
- Player movement and combat  
- Enemy AI logic  
- Loot and exploration systems  
- Logging and demo modules
